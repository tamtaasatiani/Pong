# Pong
A game of Pong made in C++, uses the SDL library.

THE PROJECT ISN'T PLAYABLE YET, IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS

tahm is a tool/framework that will hopefully simplify the process of making games with C++ later on, it uses the SDL library.
When this project is finished, tahm will also be uploaded saparately.
